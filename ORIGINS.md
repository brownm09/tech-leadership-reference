# Origins — Where These Frameworks Come From

Every framework in this repo was developed from real work, not synthesized from best practices. This document traces each playbook back to the specific engagement, problem, and outcome that produced it, and provides first-person framing that grounds each framework as lived experience.

**Columns:**
- **Engagement** — employer and timeframe
- **Origin** — the specific problem or program that produced the framework
- **Outcome** — measurable result where available
- **In my own words** — safe first-person framing for how to describe this work

## Notes

The framings in "In my own words" accurately reflect personal ownership — they describe what was personally designed, owned, or driven, not what teams executed. For the full operational context behind each decision, see the playbooks themselves.

The M&A diligence framework is the one exception: it does not derive from a single acquisition engagement. It synthesizes the technical assessment posture developed across multi-year platform, compliance, and DR programs that required the same rigor as a formal diligence sprint.
