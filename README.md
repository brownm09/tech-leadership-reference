# Tech Leadership Playbooks

Operational and leadership frameworks from production engineering work across payments, platform, and compliance contexts. Each document reflects decisions made in real systems, not hypothetical best practices. Organized by the leadership domain each framework addresses.

**[ORIGINS.md](ORIGINS.md)** traces each framework back to the specific engagement, program, and outcome that produced it, with first-person framing for each.

**[LINKING.md](LINKING.md)** documents the convention for cross-references to [lifting-logbook](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook) as a demonstration sandbox for frameworks where production experience is not the basis of the claim.

## Transitions & New Leader Toolkit

Frameworks for the first 90–360 days in a new engineering leadership role, and the full engineer lifecycle from first day to fully ramped.

**[transitions/new-leader-30-60-90.md](transitions/new-leader-30-60-90.md)**
Phased framework for an engineering leader joining a new org. Covers the listening tour (days 1–30), diagnosis and early action (days 31–60), and committing to a direction (days 61–90). Includes a 90-180-360 extension for larger orgs or turnaround situations, anti-patterns, and reusable templates for the listening tour 1:1 and the 90-day written assessment. Grounded in the ActBlue platform directorate ramp and the CTA technical leadership onboarding.

**[transitions/inheriting-a-team.md](transitions/inheriting-a-team.md)**
Companion to the 30-60-90 for the specific dynamics of stepping into an existing team you did not hire. Covers the three predecessor archetypes (beloved, embattled, absent), loyalty traps (passed-over team members, informal authority figures), the trust signals the team is watching for in weeks 1–4, and early personnel decisions. Includes modified listening tour questions and a personnel decision decision tree.

**[transitions/new-hire-onboarding-framework.md](transitions/new-hire-onboarding-framework.md)**
The 30-day plan handed to an incoming engineer — the complement to the new-leader 30-60-90. Covers the three-phase ramp (orientation, first contribution, independent delivery), the three roles (manager, buddy, new hire), ramp metrics, and the most common onboarding failure modes. Includes a 30-day checklist, manager kick-off agenda, buddy guide, and 30-day retrospective format. Grounded in onboarding across six platform teams at ActBlue and the CTA engineering team.

## Context

These frameworks were developed and applied across high-volume, regulated platforms including a payments processor handling 1M+ transactions/day under PCI-DSS. They span the full scope of engineering leadership: from org design and technical strategy at the director level, to operating cadence and executive communication at the chief-of-staff level, to cross-team program delivery at the TPM level. They are written to be adapted, not followed verbatim. The right answer for your system depends on your scale, team structure, and constraints.
